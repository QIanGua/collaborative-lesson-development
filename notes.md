1.  Reduce, re-use, recycle.
    -   Don't create a new lesson if there's one out there you can use and/or contribute to.
    -   Check the license/ask permission before re-using.
2.  Build lessons, not courses.
    -   Every instructor's needs are different, so build small chunks that can be repurposed in many ways.
    -   Analogy: libraries of re-usable functions are more useful than monolithic applications.
3.  Design the lesson backward, but describe it forward.
    -   Quick review of reverse instructional design.
    -   But describe forward (since that's comprehension order).
4.  Be clear who your lesson is for.
    -   Describe prerequisite knowledge, equipment or software required, etc.
    -   Learner profiles are often clearer than itemized lists.
5.  Encourage lots of little contributions.
    -   Steady improvement and adaptation increases longevity of lesson.
    -   Provide an on-ramp for new contributors.
    -   Next three points are about reducing social and technical barriers to contribution.
6.  Be explicit about the license, code of conduct, governance (esp. who can do what), and contribution procedure.
    -   Lower the social barriers to contribution.
    -   Copy existing ones rather than creating your own.
    -   Pointers to models.
7.  Use tools and formats that support pre-merge review.
    -   Lower the technical barriers to contribution.
    -   Google Docs with comments is OK.
    -   GitHub with pull requests is better, but has a very large startup cost.
    -   Wikis that allow review for pending changes are a good balance.
8.  Make it easy for people to submit errata and suggestions.
    -   An even gentler on-ramp for new contributors.
    -   The 90/9/1 rule (90% of people watch, 9% discuss, 1% do).
    -   Requires someone to do triage (see earlier point about governance).
9.  Support threaded discussion.
    -   Because a single channel will have a low signal-to-noise ratio from most people's points of view.
10. Publish each lesson periodically, and give people credit when you do.
    -   Give people credit in a digestible way as a reward for contributing.
    -   List the lesson's maintainers as editors (since everyone understands that role).
    -   Tell people what the release schedule is.
    -   Give all contributors credit when you publish (having been clear up front who counts as a contributor).

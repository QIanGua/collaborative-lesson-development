Lessons take significant effort to build,
and even more effort to maintain.
The collaborative code development methods pioneered by the open source community
offer a way forward,
allowing us to create lessons which are open,
accessible,
and continually updated and improved by a community of contributors.
This paper provides ten simple rules that can help others create sustainable lessons.
